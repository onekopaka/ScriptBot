xPlugins are extra plugins written by scriptbot users which serve a purpose, but
are not worth inclusion with the bot itself. All plugins stored here are not
automatically under any license (nor that of ScriptBot), but rather of the license
given by the author in the plugin's file. Those without a license are copyright
the original author (unless stated) and those without an author can be considered
public domain.

If an xPlugin is something worth having included with the core bot, the appropriate
authors will be contacted. Nothing will be done without original author's consent.
