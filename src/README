Please note that the base plugins have also been edited to run with ScriptBot GUI.

Main differences:
	Instead of using variable: core
	Must now use getter: getCore()

	Instead of using object: Util
	Must now use getter: getUtil()

	Event.MESSAGE, etc. must now be a string "MESSAGE" instead.
	(Subject to change in later commits)
