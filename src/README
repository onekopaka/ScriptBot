ScriptBot by AMcBain

Some stuff from irc.mozilla.org/#bots

<AMcBain> (on a side note, that isn't pure Rhino, I hacked PircBot inside it and reJARed it)

<AMcBain> whatever suits. I mean it's a bot that uses PircBot to get onto IRC then after that, the rest is all JavaScript.

Summary

* Based on Rhino with PircBot added in.
* Most is Javascript
* Requires both js.jar and PircBot.jar

Other Notes

You MUST have java in your path. else, it won't work.
