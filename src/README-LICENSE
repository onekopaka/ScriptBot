Some stuff from irc.mozilla.org/#bots

SUMMARY:

ScriptBot is an IRC bot written in JavaScript using Java via Rhino to get the necessary classes
to connect to IRC. ScriptBot offers a plugin based model for maximum flexibility in features as
well as a small API to help in doing other functions not directly related to IRC events.

REQUIREMENTS:

Java must be installed on the machine the bot is to be run on. Minimum Java version
is limited by Rhino, so it is probably Java 5.0 or higher, though 6.0 is recommended.
